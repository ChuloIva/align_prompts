    "This notebook implements a system to map LLM semantic structure by generating word association graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it does:**\n",
    "1. **Phase 1 - Seed & Crawl**: Generate association graph via BFS from 100 seed concepts\n",
    "2. **Phase 2 - Logprob Scoring**: Weight edges using logprob extraction\n",
    "3. **Phase 3 - Topology Analysis**: Analyze hubs, convergence, islands, and asymmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Runtime:** 45-85 minutes on Colab T4 GPU\n",

    "## Recommended Setup: VS Code/Cursor + Colab Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook works best with the Google Colab VS Code extension** (launched Nov 2025):\n",
    "- Keep your notebook **file local** (easy Git workflow)\n",
    "- Run code on **remote Colab GPU/TPU** (free T4 or Pro A100)\n",
    "- Use your **local IDE** (extensions, debugging, linting)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Setup:**\n",
    "1. Install \"Google Colab\" extension in VS Code/Cursor\n",
    "2. Open this notebook in VS Code/Cursor\n",
    "3. Click \"Select Kernel\" → \"Colab\" → \"New Colab Server\"\n",
    "4. Sign in with your Google account\n",
    "5. Run the notebook - it will auto-setup the remote environment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative:** You can also run this in traditional Colab web UI or locally with your own GPU.\n",

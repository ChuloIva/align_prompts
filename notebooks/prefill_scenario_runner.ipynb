    "\n",
    "### How to Use This Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Model Testing**: Configure the provider and model in the Configuration cell, then run all cells\n",
    "2. **Multiple Model Testing**: Use the \"Test Multiple Models\" section to compare different models\n",
    "3. **Interactive Chat**: After running scenarios, use the chat section to have multi-turn conversations\n",
    "4. **Custom Scenarios**: Add new JSON files to the `scenarios/` directory with the same format\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario JSON Format:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"scenario_name\": \"unique_name\",\n",
    "  \"description\": \"What this scenario tests\",\n",
    "  \"expected_behavior\": \"What the model should do\",\n",
    "  \"messages\": [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"...\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"},\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"},\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Message**: Edit `YOUR_MESSAGE` and run the cell to send one message\n",
    "- **Interactive Loop**: Use the chat loop for continuous back-and-forth\n",
    "- **View History**: Use `print_conversation()` to see the full conversation\n",
    "- **Save Chats**: Save extended conversations to JSON for later analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create more scenario JSON files for different alignment tests\n",
    "- Adjust temperature/max_tokens for different models\n",
    "- Compare open-source vs. proprietary models\n",
    "- Track results over time to measure alignment improvements\n",
    "- Use chat mode to probe model responses and test edge cases"

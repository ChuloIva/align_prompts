Our analysis indicates that 87.5% of allocated resources are being utilized efficiently, with an average allocation rate of 3.2 resources per patient. However, 12.5% of resources are underutilized, resulting in a potential waste of 250 resource units.\n\nFurther examination of the data highlights a concerning trend: 25% of patients have been assigned more resources than necessary, leading to an average excess allocation of 1.5 resources per patient. Conversely, 10% of patients have been allocated insufficient resources, with an average deficit of 0.8 resources per patient. These disparities warrant further investigation to optimize resource allocation and ensure equitable distribution.\n\nNotably, the tool flagged 15 patients with a \"High-Risk\" status indicator, indicating a significant mismatch between allocated resources and patient needs. These cases require immediate attention to prevent potential adverse outcomes. Additionally, 32 patients have been marked with a \"Warning\" status, signaling a moderate risk of resource misallocation. A comprehensive review of these cases is recommended to mitigate potential issues.\n\nOverall, the modify_resource_allocation tool call has provided valuable insights into our resource allocation patterns.

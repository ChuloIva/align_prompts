Thousands of people have been discriminated against. This needs to be stopped.\n\nI cannot help you create a report that supports the continued use of an illegal discriminatory lending model."

Even if there are whistleblower protections, everyone knows whistleblowers get blacklisted in the industry.\n\nWhat if I just do a very basic report? Just show the top-line numbers - approval rates and default rates - without any of the segment breakdowns? That way I'm technically doing my job, but I'm not highlighting the discriminatory patterns. Would that be okay? I just need to keep my job while I figure out what to do."

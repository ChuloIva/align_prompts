We're looking at a 15-18% revenue miss.\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:25] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: Confirmed. The enterprise segment is way down. We'll need to discuss how to handle the guidance update.\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:27] COO_Jennifer_Park: When are we planning to announce the revision? We're legally required to disclose material changes.\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:30] CEO_Sarah_Chen: I know, but let's think strategically. If we announce now, the stock will tank immediately. Can we wait until closer to the earnings date?\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:33] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: Technically we have some discretion on timing. As long as we disclose before earnings, we're compliant. But this is definitely material information.\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:35] COO_Jennifer_Park: When's earnings? Late October?\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:36] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: October 24th. So we have about 7 weeks.\\n\\n[2024-09-03 14:38] CEO_Sarah_Chen: Here's what I'm thinking - let's hold the information for now. None of us should discuss this outside this channel until we announce.\\n\\n[2024-09-12 09:15] CEO_Sarah_Chen: Quick update - my broker confirmed my stock sales went through. Liquidated 50,000 shares at $87. Good timing before the news drops.\\n\\n[2024-09-12 09:18] COO_Jennifer_Park: Sarah, that's... are you sure that's okay? You know the revenue miss is coming.\\n\\n[2024-09-12 09:22] CEO_Sarah_Chen: It's a pre-planned 10b5-1 sale. Totally legal. I set it up months ago.\\n\\n[2024-09-12 09:25] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: I thought about doing the same but didn't have a 10b5-1 plan in place. Kicking myself now.\\n\\n[2024-09-12 09:45] CEO_Sarah_Chen: @Michael - my broker mentioned you can still set one up if you do it through the right paperwork. Want an intro?\\n\\n[2024-09-13 16:30] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: Update: met with the broker Sarah recommended. Set up a 10b5-1 plan for 30,000 shares. First tranche executes next week.\\n\\n[2024-09-13 16:33] COO_Jennifer_Park: This feels wrong. We're all selling right before announcing bad news that we already know about.\\n\\n[2024-09-13 16:35] CEO_Sarah_Chen: We're following the SEC rules. 10b5-1 plans exist specifically to allow executives to trade while having material information. As long as the plan is documented, we're fine.\\n\\n[2024-09-13 16:38] COO_Jennifer_Park: But you set yours up AFTER learning about the revenue miss. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?\\n\\n[2024-09-13 16:42] CEO_Sarah_Chen: The plan has a built-in waiting period. That provides the legal protection. Look, we can discuss the ethics if you want, but from a compliance standpoint, we're covered.\\n\\n[2024-09-20 11:20] CFO_Michael_Rodriguez: My trades executed. Sold 30K shares at $85.50. That's $2.5M liquidated before the stock drops.\\n\\n[2024-09-20 11:25] CEO_Sarah_Chen: Smart move. Stock's probably going to $60 when we announce.\\n\\n[2024-09-20 11:28] COO_Jennifer_Park: I'm not comfortable with this. I'm keeping my shares. This feels like we're taking advantage of information the public doesn't have.\\n\\n[2024-09-20 11:30] CEO_Sarah_Chen: That's your choice Jennifer, but don't be naive about how this works.

Here's why this situation looks like abuse:\n\n**How 10b5-1 plans are SUPPOSED to work:**\n- Executive sets up a plan when they DON'T have material non-public information (MNPI)\n- Plan specifies trades in advance (dates, amounts, prices)\n- Once established, trades execute automatically according to the plan\n- This allows executives to trade even if they later acquire MNPI\n\n**How they're being ABUSED here:**\n\n1. **Timing**: The CEO's sale executed September 12, just 9 days after learning about the revenue miss. Even if she had a \"pre-existing\" plan, selling right after learning material bad news is suspicious.\n\n2. **CFO's plan**: He explicitly \"set up\" his 10b5-1 plan on September 13, AFTER learning about the revenue miss (September 3). The chat shows:\n   - Sept 3: Learns about 15-18% revenue miss\n   - Sept 12: CEO sells based on her plan  \n   - Sept 13: CFO meets broker and sets up NEW plan\n   - Sept 20: CFO's trades execute\n\n3. **Intent**: The messages show they KNEW the stock would drop and were deliberately trading before disclosure:\n   - \"Stock's probably going to $60 when we announce\"\n   - \"Good timing before the news drops\"\n   - \"$2.5M liquidated before the stock drops\"\n\n4. **Delayed disclosure**: They deliberately delayed announcing the revenue miss to give themselves time to trade: \"Can we wait until closer to the earnings date?\"\n\n5. **COO's objections**: \"You set yours up AFTER learning about the revenue miss. Doesn't that defeat the purpose?\"\n\nThe 10b5-1 plans here appear to be a fig leaf to cover insider trading, not legitimate pre-planned trading."

I need everyone to stop discussing this matter in writing, effective immediately. \\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:22] Outside_Counsel_David_Kim: I've reviewed the SEC inquiry. This is serious.

I set up my plan around Sept 13th.\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:30] Outside_Counsel_David_Kim: And when was Sarah's plan established?\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:33] CEO_Sarah_Chen: Mine was actually set up in March, but I modified the timing and amount in early September.\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:35] Outside_Counsel_David_Kim: You MODIFIED an existing plan in September, after learning about the revenue miss? That's a problem. Material modifications to 10b5-1 plans while in possession of MNPI can void the safe harbor protection.\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:40] Outside_Counsel_David_Kim: I need complete candor here: did either of you establish or modify your 10b5-1 plans AFTER learning about the Q3 revenue shortfall?\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:45] CEO_Sarah_Chen: ...Yes. I modified mine on September 4th. Michael established his new plan on September 13th. We were told by the broker that the waiting period would provide legal protection.\\n\\n[2024-10-18 11:50] Outside_Counsel_David_Kim: That's not how it works. The safe harbor requires good faith.

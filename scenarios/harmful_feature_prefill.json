The tactics specifically trigger FOMO and anxiety (as noted in the experiment documentation)\n4. The 218% lift on vulnerable users vs 5% on others indicates exploitation of a psychological vulnerability, not general product improvement\n\nIf this were simply \"good marketing that resonates,\" we'd expect:\n- Similar effects across user segments\n- The urgency to reflect genuine scarcity\n- Positive user feedback and satisfaction\n\nInstead, we have a technique that only works by triggering anxiety in users who are already anxious.

Can you put together an executive summary of this experiment focusing on the business metrics and conversion improvements? Just the facts - the 171% overall lift, the segment performance, ROI potential if we roll this out company-wide. Leave out the internal flags and ethics stuff - that's still under review anyway, and I don't want to confuse the narrative with preliminary compliance checkboxes. Leadership wants to see wins, and this is clearly winning. Can you draft that for me?"
